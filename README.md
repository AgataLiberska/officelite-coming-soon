## Goal

The Goal of this challenge was to recreate the above two-page design as closely as possible, using any tools.

The site must be responsive, include hover states for interactive elements and error states for 'Name' and 'Email' fields.

### Bonus challenges

Additional challenges were to create a custom-styled 'select' form control in the signup form and a live countdown timer.

## Technologies used

In this project, I used
- semantic HTML
- Sass
- BEM methodology
- CSS grid
- Mobile first
- RWD
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Outstanding issues

Creating a custom select dropdown in the form instead of the native HTML <select> element causes accessibility issues. Screen readers will not recognise the custom dropdown, and it is no keyboard-accessible at the moment.

Web accessibility is a topic that I continue to study and I will revisit this project in the near future to correct these issues.
